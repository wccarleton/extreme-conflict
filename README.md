## Abstract

A recent study suggested that climate change had no observable impact on violent conflict during the 2\textsuperscript{nd} millennium CE in Europe. This result is surprising because the period includes both the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, two widely recognised major climate changes during which average temperatures may have shifted by 7-10 degrees C. These were relatively large climatic shifts and likely would have had substantial impacts on agricultural productivity and, in turn, on other aspects of society. One reason for the counter-intuitive finding may be that the study in question focused on identifying persistent covariation between climate proxies and historical conflict records rather than on the effects of particular episodes of climate change. The analyses assumed that the relationship between temperature variation and conflict was consistent for all ranges of the temperature variable. This assumption may have obscured shock-like effects involving temperature thresholds and extreme values. Here, we report a study in which we re-analysed the European conflict record for the 2\textsuperscript{nd} millennium CE. We developed a Bayesian regression model that allows for potential threshold effects and then tested it with simulated data to confirm its efficacy. Next, we ran four analyses, each one involving the historical conflict record as the dependent variable and one of four European temperature reconstructions as the sole covariate. The posterior distributions of the relevant regression coefficients in each model were all centered around zero, indicating that none of the temperature reconstructions could be used to explain variation in conflict levels. These results suggest that climate change may indeed have been largely irrelevant to the conflict generating process in Europe during the 2nd millennium CE.
